    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository with Next.js and Tailwind CSS",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js and Tailwind CSS setup process into sequential steps including repository initialization, framework installation, CSS configuration, folder structure setup, and code quality tools integration.",
      "reasoning": "This is a standard project setup task with well-documented steps. The complexity is moderate as it involves multiple technologies (Next.js, Tailwind, Git, ESLint, Prettier) but follows established patterns with good documentation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate Supabase for Authentication and Database",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the step-by-step process for Supabase integration, including project creation, database schema design, authentication configuration, environment setup, client utility implementation, and context provider development.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity as it involves both authentication and database setup with Supabase. It requires understanding of database design, authentication flows, and integration with Next.js context system."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement User Account Management",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the user account management implementation into discrete components: registration form, login system, profile page development, profile editing functionality, protected routes implementation, and database triggers for user statistics.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple UI components and complex authentication flows. It requires form validation, state management, protected routes, and database triggers, making it relatively complex."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Game Session Creation and Joining",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for game session management: creation form, unique URL generation, joining mechanism, session data storage, lobby interface, host controls, and realtime subscription implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the realtime nature of game sessions. It requires unique ID generation, realtime database updates, and multiple UI components for different user roles (host vs participant)."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Build Gameplay Phase Tracking System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the phase tracking system into components: state machine design, phase-specific UI components, transition logic, dice input mechanism, game board visualization, realtime synchronization, and host control implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it involves state management across multiple game phases, realtime synchronization between players, and complex UI representations. The state machine needs to handle various transitions and edge cases."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Score Calculation and Action Tracking",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the implementation steps for score calculation: action-based scoring logic, player action tracking UI, running score visualization, move validation system, visual feedback mechanisms, and rule compliance verification.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing complex game rules and calculations. It involves validation logic, real-time updates, and ensuring the calculations match the official game rules exactly."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Persistent Game Results and Statistics",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the statistics system implementation: database functions for stats updates, game history page, profile statistics section, performance visualizations, and database optimization for queries.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves database design and visualization of statistics. The complexity comes from ensuring efficient queries and creating meaningful visualizations, but it's more straightforward than the core gameplay mechanics."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement In-game Notifications and Alerts",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the steps for building the notification system: notification component design, phase change triggers, achievement notification logic, and end-game summary implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex as it requires integration with the game state but follows standard notification patterns. The main challenge is ensuring notifications are timely and non-disruptive."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Design and Implement Ancient Greece-inspired UI",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI design implementation into: color palette creation, custom component styling, responsive layout development, themed iconography design, animation implementation, and accessibility compliance.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires both design skills and technical implementation. Creating a cohesive theme across all components while ensuring responsiveness and accessibility adds significant complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Finalize and Deploy MVP",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the final deployment process: comprehensive testing plan, bug fixing methodology, performance optimization steps, production environment setup, and post-deployment verification.",
      "reasoning": "While this task depends on many others, the actual deployment process follows standard patterns. The complexity comes from ensuring all components work together correctly in production and handling any unexpected issues."
